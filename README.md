### 👋 Hi, I’m Caroline
I'm excited about about **AI for autonomy**, **machine learning**, and **computer vision**.

### 🤖 Upcoming Projects with [SISL](https://github.com/sisl)  

- 🚚 **[Validation for a Real-World Autonomous Trucking System](https://github.com/sisl/SimpleADPStack)** – Using [RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01909) & [Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08459) to discover likely failures fast.  

- ✈️ **[Vision-Based Autonomous Taxiing](https://github.com/sisl/VisualTaxiULI)** – My contribution: preliminary particle filter that uses camera-based segmentation maps to estimate the plane's true position/orientation. 

### ✨ Highlights So Far

- ☕ **[Mug Makeover](https://github.com/thomas-yim/cs231n-final)** – Generating realistic ray-traced images from rasterized renders. Used a pix2pix cGAN & achieved results 4.5× faster than traditional ray tracing.

- 📷 **[Pivot](https://github.com/cs210/Pivot)** – Mobile-first 360° virtual tour creation using just your phone. A cheap & fast alternative to Matterport.

- 🏝️ **[Catan Conqueror](https://github.com/Proud19/catan238)** – Building RL agents to rule the island. Q-learning agent achieved 85% win rate.
  
- 🎵 **[Music Embedding Evaluation](https://github.com/ccahilly/music-embedding)** – Compareing music embedding models (CLAP, Wav2Vec 2.0, and MERT) for downstream tasks like genre classification and music captioning.
  
- 🏃‍♀️ **[Stanford Running Club Website](https://github.com/pythonicode/src)** – Shameless plug for [Stanford Running Club](https://stanfordrunningclub.com/). Credit to [Anthony Riley](https://github.com/pythonicode).
