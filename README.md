👋 Hi, I’m Caroline.  
🤖 Passionate about AI for autonomy, machine learning, and computer vision.  
**🔬 Upcoming Projects with Stanford’s Intelligent Systems Lab**
- 🚚 [Validation for a Real-World Autonomous Trucking System](https://github.com/sisl/SimpleADPStack) – Using [RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01909) & [DiFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08459) to discover likely failures fast.  
- ✈️ [Vision-Based Autonomous Taxiing](https://github.com/sisl/VisualTaxiULI) – Developed a particle filter integrating camera-based segmentation maps for autonomous airplane taxiing.  

**🎯 Previous Projects**  
- ☕ [Mug Makeover](https://github.com/thomas-yim/cs231n-final) – Generating Realistic Ray-Traced Images from Rasterized Renders. Used a pix2pix cGAN & achieved results 4.5× faster than traditional ray tracing.
- 📷 [Pivot](https://github.com/cs210/Pivot) – Mobile-first 360° virtual tour creation using just your phone. Worlds cheaper & faster than Matterport.  
- 🏝️ [Catan Conqueror](https://github.com/Proud19/catan238) – Building bots to rule the island. Designed multiple intelligent agents. Q-learning agent achieved 85% win rate in two-player Catan.  
- 🎵 [Music Embedding Evaluation](https://github.com/yourusername/music-embedding) – Compared music embedding models (CLAP, Wav2Vec 2.0, and MERT) for downstream tasks like genre classification and music captioning. 
- 🏃‍♀️ [Stanford Running Club](https://stanfordrunningclub.com/) – Shameless plug for [Stanford Running Club](https://stanfordrunningclub.com/). Credit goes to @pythonicode.
