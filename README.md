### 🤖 Upcoming Projects with [SISL](https://github.com/sisl)  
- 🚚 **[Validation for a Real-World Autonomous Trucking System](https://github.com/sisl/SimpleADPStack)** – Using [RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01909) & [DiFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08459) to rapidly discover likely failures in an AD stack.  
- ✈️ **[Vision-Based Autonomous Taxiing](https://github.com/sisl/VisualTaxiULI)** – My contribution: Implemented a particle filter leveraging camera-based segmentation maps to estimate the plane’s true position and orientation.

### ✨ Project Highlights  
- ☕ **[Mug Makeover](https://github.com/thomas-yim/cs231n-final)** – GAN-generated ray-traced imagery from rasterized renders using a pix2pix cGAN; **4.5× faster** than traditional ray tracing.  
- 📷 **[Pivot](https://github.com/cs210/Pivot)** – Mobile-first 360° virtual tour creation using only a phone; fast, affordable alternative to Matterport.  
- 🏝️ **[Catan Conqueror](https://github.com/Proud19/catan238)** – Designed multiple RL agents; Q-learning agent achieved **85% win rate** in two-player Catan after 15k iterations.  
- 🎵 **[Music Embedding Evaluation](https://github.com/ccahilly/music-embedding)** – Compared CLAP, Wav2Vec 2.0, and MERT embeddings for genre classification & music captioning.  
- 🏃‍♀️ **[Stanford Running Club](https://github.com/pythonicode/src)** – Shameless plug for the [Stanford Running Club website](https://stanfordrunningclub.com/). Credit to [Anthony Riley](https://github.com/pythonicode).
